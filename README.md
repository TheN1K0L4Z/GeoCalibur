DLC-quality Freelancer Addon for Discovery Mod - GeoCalibur Industries

This is an Attempt at a non-flmod addon for Freelancer, this uses the latest offical build of Discovery Freelancer (4.88.1 as of this writing).

WARNING: This version of GC assumes you have copied the modded directory, unmodified. This is meant to be a Singleplayer Mod, so it is important to copy the folder and all inside contents of Disco to another folder, as an appended instance. After you DL project as an archive copy contents into your copied instance, NOT THE ORIGINAL!!

E.G.
Before Copy -
D:\Users\Nick\AppData\Local\

Folders:

"Discovery Freelancer 4.88.1"

After Copy -
D:\Users\Nick\AppData\Local\

Folders:

"Discovery Freelancer 4.88.1"

"Discovery Freelancer 4.88.1-N1" (replace content in here)

Your directory for Disco may differ, but keep the instances in one directory.
